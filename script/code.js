// 1variable
// a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed

// 2 value

//3 data type
// a set of values and a set of operations defined on those values

// 4 initialization
// Initializing a variable means specifying an initial value to assign to it

// diff between let var and const
// let 
// let does not allow to redeclare variables.

// var is function scoped.
// var allows to redeclare variables.

// const 
// If you never want a variable to change 

// variable scope
// the scope of a variable is the block of code in the entire program where the variable is declared, used, and can be modified.

// When can you decide when to use a for or while, forEach and do while loop?

//7 when to use a for or while, forEach and do while loop
// A for Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code a number of times that is known.
// A while Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code an unknown number of times until the conditions are met.
// A foreach loop is used when you need to operate on each item individually in an array.
// A do while loop is used in all scenarios where the loop body needs to be executed at least once.


// Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

// varible scope 
// refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript.
